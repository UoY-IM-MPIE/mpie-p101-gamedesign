# Practical 10.1: Game Design and Catchup

In the last lecture, you learned about various guidelines and theories about game design. Consider applying this to one of your environments or working on your assessment. 

Please catchup on previous practicals if you need to. I have highlighted some extensions and challenges below from previous practicals. 

These include some features and bits of code that you should be able to do and find useful when working on your assessment. 

## Challenges from previous practicals 

-	Restart a level/scene depending on an ingame event: https://gist.github.com/NovaSurfer/e96f3777ca7a4c46f391634ec65dc695
-	Use Unity’s tree creator to make your own custom tree model. You can find more information on using the tree creator: https://docs.unity3d.com/2018.4/Documentation/Manual/tree-FirstTree.html
-	Explore how to add water in your scene. Some options may be available from standard assets: https://docs.unity3d.com/560/Documentation/Manual/HOWTO-Water.html
-	Experiment with how the ‘Doppler Level’ parameter changes the way that an Audio Source attached to a moving object sounds (see more information [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect)).
-	Use a second camera to add a Minimap to your HUD (see https://youtu.be/ZuV9Xlt-l6g)
-	Use Unity’s instantiate function to spawn multiple game objects in the scene (see http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/InstantiatingPrefabs.html)
